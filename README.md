<summary><h3>ðŸ’» My Coding Journey </h3><summary>
"I began coding while working as a sous-chef. I noticed that a significant amount of time was being wasted on traveling, so I took a chance on myself and left my job to pursue a career in programming. As a self-taught programmer, I gained many valuable skills. I had to do a lot of research on my own, and after trying various online resources, I settled on using Scrimba and FreeCodeCamp.org to hone my coding abilities. I am dedicated to learning new concepts every day and pushing myself to expand my knowledge."
