<summary><h3>ðŸ’» My Coding Journey </h3><summary>
I started to code when I was a sous-chef. I realised that a lot of time was wasted on traveling from work to home and vice versa so I decided to take a chance on myself and quit to pursue coding. I decided to start my journey programmer. Being a self taught programmer taught me many valuable skills. I had to do a lot of goggling on my own and after trying a lot of online resources I settled on doing scrimba alongside freecodecamp.org to hone my coding skills. I try to push myself to learn new ideas everyday.
